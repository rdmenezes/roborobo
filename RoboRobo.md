# Introduction #
RoboRobo is a fast 2D simulator for swarms of robots. It is developed entirely in C++ and uses the SDL library for display. It can also be run without any user interface, allowing it to be run on virtually any unix-like system including large scale clusters.

# Flavours #
RoboRobo currently comes in two flavours

  * RoboRobo - The original version developed by Nicolas Bredeche in Paris
  * RoboRoboOrganisms - A version with support for modular robot organisms developed by Berend Weel in Amsterdam
